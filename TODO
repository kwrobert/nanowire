1) Fix convergence plotting. Right now the ways things are sorted breaks plotting of
convergence when number of basis vectors is looped over along with some other parameters. Need modify convergence
calculator and plotter to handle calculating error between variations in a single parameter while
fixing others then creating multiple error.dat files and plotting them. 
2) Fix simulation subproccesing in sim_wrapper so we get output/feedback from S4 library when
verbosity > 1
3) Fix automatic post processing so we get feedback to stdout as well as logs
4) Add parallelization amoung list of SSH accessible hosts (paramiko, need pub keys exchanged ahead
of time)
5) Add error checking of plane values in setup.ini to make sure they do not exceed number of samples
