1) Fix simulation subproccesing in sim_wrapper so we get output/feedback from S4 library when
verbosity > 1
2) Fix automatic post processing so we get feedback to stdout as well as logs
3) Add parallelization amoung list of SSH accessible hosts (paramiko, need pub keys exchanged ahead
of time)
4) Add error checking of plane values in setup.ini to make sure they do not exceed number of samples
5) Add an Evaluated Parameters section that evaluates certain parameters based on values of other
   params. Ex: Want to keep total diameter of wire fixed but need to vary ratio of core diameter
   to shell thickness. Will need to extend parser class from config parser module to add this 
   function. Use inheritance.
