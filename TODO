Code
====

1) Fix simulation subproccesing in sim_wrapper so we get output/feedback from S4 library when
   verbosity > 1
2) Fix automatic post processing so we get feedback to stdout as well as logs
3) Add error checking of plane values in setup.ini to make sure they do not exceed number of samples
4) Parallelize postprocessing
5) Add capability to look up minimum number of basis terms to sim_wrapper 
    a) Will need to create a database. Store number of basis terms for each combination of
       frequency and some reasonable number of geometric parameters. 
6) Add function to compute and plot generation rate in postprocess
7) Add counter to simulation sweeps so we know how many are left to run 

Reading
=======

1) Read Rays paper and identify any gaps in their optimization that we could fill
2) Find/ask for generation rate document Anna made and read it
3) Genetic algorithm book that I downloaded. Should be somewhere in papers/  

Simulations
===========

1) Run a full convergence analysis for different system sizes
    a) period 200 nm, radius 75
    b) period 300 nm, radius 60
2) Run simulation with fixed total nanowire radius, but vary ratio between shell thickness
   and core radius
