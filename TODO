1) Fix simulation subproccesing in sim_wrapper so we get output/feedback from S4 library when
   verbosity > 1
2) Fix automatic post processing so we get feedback to stdout as well as logs
3) Add parallelization amoung list of SSH accessible hosts (paramiko, need pub keys exchanged ahead
of time)
4) Add error checking of plane values in setup.ini to make sure they do not exceed number of samples
5) Parallelize postprocessing
6) Perhaps save crunched data to numpy savez format to increase parsing speed for future
   postprocessing
7) Add capability to look up minimum number of basis terms to sim_wrapper 
8) Write script to compute and plot time scaling with # of basis terms
9) Add function to compute and plot generation rate in postprocess
10) Make minimum basis term plots bar graphs instead of line plots!!
