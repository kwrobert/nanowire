This is a file to document possible reasons of discrepancy between Anna's simulations and mine:

1) Anna uses nearest neighbor interpolate when computing values of n,k on a grid point. 
2) Slightly different grids. Should be fixable by interpolating one set of data points on
to the other set of data points/values.
